## Cloud Desktop - Windows 2019 Server Base Image

A clean development workstation in the cloud, installed with every tool you might need when hosting coding sessions. For example in a Code Retreat, Mob-Programming events or any other occasion where a clean machine with tools included might be useful. 

Let me know what you think and how you are using it ðŸ¤™


### Install Development Environment

Open an administrative PowerShell, and copy&paste the following command:

    Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mob-programming-meetup/cloud-desktop/master/install.windows.ps1 | Invoke-Expression

Note: Have a look at [install.windows.ps1](./install.windows.ps1) first. You might want to check if the installed packages are not suspicious and/or adapt the script to your own needs. PRs are always welcome ðŸŽ‰

### Google Cloud Setup

Create VM in the cloud:

* Create a new VM instance in the Google Cloud Platform ([Compute Engine](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute)).
* Choose a region close to your audience, in order to minimize latency.
* Choose a machine type depending on your budget and requirements. For example a 4 vCPU + 16 GB memory running a Windows OS costs approx. 0.35 $ per hour (region: europe-west4). The estimated price is shown in the top right.
* Expand "CPU platform and GPU" 
* Enable "Turn on display device" in order to allow screen sharing connection via Anydesk or TeamViewer.
* Select the Boot Disk "Windows Server 2019 Datacenter". Note: The Server Core Windows versions do not include the Windows Desktop features.
* A disk size of 70 GB or greater is recommended.
* Click on "Create" and wait until the instance gets created.

Connect to the VM in the cloud via RDP:
* Download the RDP file from the menu next to the instance
* Set + copy the windows password from the same menu.
* Log in to the machine
    * Windows: Open it with the Remote Desktop application.
    * MacOS: Install the Microsft Remote Desktop App from the Mac App Store: https://apps.apple.com/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466
* Go to the Accounts Settings/Sign-in Options to change the Windows password. You might choose one which is more simple to type, as you can not copy & paste the password when you need to unlock the machine via Anydesk.
* Create a setup file
    * Create a directory c:\bat
    * Use notepad to create a file dev-setup.ps1 in that directory
    * Paste in contents from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mob-programming-meetup/cloud-desktop/master/install.windows.ps1
    * Edit to add or remove choclatey packages for your favotite development packages - AnyDesk is recommended at a minimum
* Run file as administrator
    * Start cmd shell or Powershell
    * Run the following command:  Start-Process powershell -Verb runAs
    * Run: \bat\install.windows.ps1
  

**After the installation script finished (~ 30-90 min):**

* Open installed software packages you plan on using which will initiate installation
* Start Anydesk to configure a pre-defined password for easier connection of your participants.

* Restart the machine.

After the preparation, you can shutdown the instance and save a machine image to avoid running costs when the instance is not used (delete the instance after successfully creating the machine image as you are still charged for the attached disk otherwise). Generally, it's recommended to re-install the instance from scratch for each session. This way you don't have to worry about security updates or misconfiguration when giving somebody else unattended access.
