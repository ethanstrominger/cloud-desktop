# Cloud Mob-Station (WIP)

This project provides instructions and scripts for easily setting up a cloud instance with a universal develop environments that can be used for Mob-Programming.

**Note:** This project is still work in progress, and not yet tested throghouly. Still I thought it's a good idea to share it already and maybe receive some improvement ideas. The idea is to turn the instructions into install scripts in the near future. 

See the instructions for:
* [Linux](./linux-mob-station.md)
* [Windows](./windows-mob-station.md)
